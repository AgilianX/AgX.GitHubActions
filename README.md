# RepositoryTemplate

A foundational GitHub repository template for AgilianX projects.

## Repository Initialization

Before starting, run the provided [initialization script](init.ps1):

```powershell
./init.ps1 # from the repository root
```

After running the script:

- Review and update this `README.md` for your project.
- After initializing the repository, you **can** delete the [init.ps1](init.ps1) script from the repository root.

    > **Recommended** You can keep it for new forks or clones of the repository. Instruct the user to run it after cloning the repository.

> [!TIP]
> For enhanced AI workflows, set the **Goal** field in your repository info file (`.github/Repository.<repo>.md`).

---

> [!TIP]
> Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/AgilianX/.agx/blob/master/README.md) in the AgX integration for additional customization options.

---

> [!NOTE]
> There is a template `copilot-instructions.md` file in the `.agx/.github/` directory.
